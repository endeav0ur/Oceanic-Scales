Oceanic-Scales
==============

Welcome the official Oceanic Scales DANM250A Github casino and spa. We have a top-notch menagerie of trained staff standing by to serve you whatever your heart may desire, however and whenever you want it.  This is of course assuming that "whatever" is source code, "however" is how we wrote it and "whenever" is immediately.  If you didn't want it immediately, you're probably out of luck because this is the internet and we're not even sure how we'd go about delayed gratification.  Weirdo.

Index:
"Processing"- Processing code, mostly for testing visual effects without a physical prototype.
"Web"- Web development sector.
"Physical"- Arduino and Raspberry Pies.  Lighting up the city skies.
