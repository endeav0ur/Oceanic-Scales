This folder contains everything having to do with the Processing LED Matrix Prototype

The processing code is in the .pde and has inline comments so it should be somewhat straightforward.
The nice thing about the processing code is that it emulates an LED matrix that is individually addressable,
and processing and sketch are almost the same programming language. 


processing.js is just some code that translates the .pde into javascript, and light.html is a sample browser
implementation.  Doesn't work in chrome right now for some lame reason, but it does work on firefox.  

Email me at tylsmith@gmail.com if you have any questions, or better yet post in the google groups.

Love, 

Tyler
